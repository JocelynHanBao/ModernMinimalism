        <div>What Is Minimalist Design?</div>
        <p>
            Minimalism has become a modern lifestyle buzzword with its own media gurus who promise that decluttering our homes and simplifying our lives will help us cope with an overwhelming world. Minimalist design, on the other hand, is an influential visual style with an established history in the realms of architecture, interiors, art, graphics, fashion, and virtually every other facet of design.

            Minimalist design is about prioritizing the essential. A minimalist building, object, or interior design is stripped to its core function, realized using limited materials, neutral colors, simple forms, and avoiding excess ornamentation to achieve a pure form of elegance. While the final expression of a minimalist design might appear effortlessly simple, as spare as a poem and as clear as a bell, achieving this kind of powerful simplicity is anything but easy.

            Minimalist design has continued to grow in popularity throughout the last century, but for every fan there is a maximalist critic who dismisses it as boring or sterile, lacking in imagination and heart. While minimalist architecture and product design can sometimes be cost-effective, eco-friendly, and may ultimately contribute to the democratization and accessibility of good design, it has also become synonymous with a rarified quest for the perfect object, a luxury that only the privileged few can afford and that can lead to its own form of perpetual excess.

            Key Characteristics of Minimalist Design

            Less is more
            Focus on functionality
            Clean, simple lines
            Sculptural forms
            Lack of superfluous ornamentation and decoration
            Monochromatic, limited color palette, with color sometimes used as an accent to create a soothing environment
            Use of limited, well chosen materials, such as concrete, steel, glass and wood
            Everything has a place and a purpose
            Use of space and natural light
            Spotlight on craftsmanship
            Interior design that is airy and uncluttered, often with open-play layouts and seamless integrated storage

            Famous Quotes About Minimalist Design

            “Less is more” –Mies Van Der Rohe, architect
            "Minimalism is not an architecture of self-denial, deprivation, or absence: it is defined not by what is not there, but by the rightness of what is there and by the richness with which this is experienced." –John Pawson, architect
            “In pure architecture the smallest detail should have a meaning or serve a purpose.” –Augustus W. N. Pugin, architect
            “As we live and as we are, Simplicity – with a capital “S” – is difficult to comprehend nowadays. We are no longer truly simple. We no longer live in simple terms or places. Life is a more complex struggle now. It is now valiant to be simple: a courageous thing to even want to be simple. It is a spiritual thing to comprehend what simplicity means.” –Frank Lloyd Wright, architect
            “I believe that architecture is a pragmatic art. To become art it must be built on a foundation of necessity.” –I. M. Pei, architect
            “An interesting plainness is the most difficult and precious thing to achieve.” –Mies Van Der Rohe, architect

        <div>8 Easy Ways To Become A Minimalist</div>
        <p>
            What is minimalism?

            Minimalism is intentionally living with only the things that you absolutely need. It’s having and being surrounded by fewer material items, so you can do more with your time and life.
            Think about it: When you have fewer dishes, you spend less time washing and drying them. You don’t have to fight for room for that final stack of Tupperware (none of which matches, by the way).
            Minimalist living allows you the freedom to spend less time and money on stuff, and spend more energy on actually living.

            How to become a minimalist

            Now that we have a basic idea of minimalism, let’s dive into eight easy steps to living a minimalist lifestyle!

            1. Set your rules for minimalism
            Minimalism is different for everyone. Some people define their minimalist lifestyle by only owning a certain number of items (like a capsule wardrobe).
            Other people achieve a minimalist lifestyle by minimizing the actual space that they take up in the world, and may seek out smaller living arrangements like a studio apartment or tiny house.
            And that’s the beauty of minimalist living: you get to look at your life — your job, the number of people in your family, your lifestyle, your needs and desires — and determine what minimalism looks like on a personal level.
            Maybe it’s simply decluttering your home. Maybe it’s moving to an apartment that’s 200 square feet smaller than your current living situation. Or maybe it’s completely downsizing your life.
            Whatever your definition of minimalism, make sure that it’s something sustainable and achievable for your life.

            2. Start with a clean slate
            As much as we all hate to admit it, there are some items in our homes that are just junk. The box that your Amazon order came in. Your favorite sweater that shrunk in the wash. The broken items that we say we will get around to fixing but obviously never do.
            In reality, these items are wasted space, and minimalism is all about maximizing space. So the first step is to start with a literal clean slate and throw out all of the trash.

            3. Use it or lose it
            Remember how we learned that minimalism is all about adopting a less is more mentality and only living with the things that you need?
            Put that to the test by implementing the Use It or Lose It Rule.
            In the midst of your initial cleaning, you may come across some items that you have used before but haven’t used recently. I call these “once upon a time items.” (As in, “Once upon a time not long ago, when people wore pajamas and lived life slow, I thought I could pull off patterned leggings.”)
            When you find these items, use the Six Month Use It or Lose It Rule. If you haven’t used it at least twice in the last six months, then it’s time to toss it.
            If it’s a seasonal item, like your winter coat or a swimsuit, then ask yourself if you used it regularly last season. If so, you can still temporarily remove it from your space with a pickup by Clutter, and have it delivered back next season. Eventually, try to work up to tossing things that you haven’t used in the last three months, and then items from the last month.
            And remember, keep only what you need now, not what you think you’ll need in the future.

            4. Organize items by category
            The next step in your minimalist journey is to organize and declutter your home.
            Some people like to organize everything by location. In this scenario, everything in the living area gets organized, and then everything in the kitchen, and then everything in the bedroom, etc.
            But think about all the places in your house where you might keep a writing utensil. At quick inspection, I found five in my living room, one in my kitchen, three in my bedroom, and there was even one in a drawer in my bathroom. If I organized each location individually, I would still end up with 10+ writing utensils.
            That’s where the KonMari method comes in. It’s one of the hottest cleaning, decluttering, and organizing methods out there right now, and one of the golden rules is to organize items by category, not by location.
            Doing so allows you to easily get rid of the duplicates. You’ll see exactly how many spoons, towels, blenders, sunglasses, shoes, and books you have. Then you can make more educated decisions about what to keep and what to toss.

            5. Ask yourself the hard questions
            Sometimes we are too emotionally tied to our sentimental items. Minimalism forces us to let go of those emotions, and focus on functionality.
            When you find yourself struggling to decide if an item should stay or should go, ask yourself these three questions:
            Is it useful?
            Is it the only one I have?
            Does it bring me joy or love?
            If you answer yes to any of the above questions, then it can stay.
            You wouldn’t throw away your only blender if you use it weekly, and you don’t have to toss your grandma’s old photo albums (here’s how to store and preserve your old photographs). But you could throw out the second blender that you have, or that old postcard from grandma that is nice, but doesn’t quite tug at your heartstrings.

            6. Combine uses
            If you’re trying to have less, then it makes sense to have items that serve more than one purpose. This is especially easy to do with kitchen utensils and appliances (like a four-in one-grater or a single bottle opener for wine and beer).
            It can also be done with other items, such as these space-saving furniture ideas for every room in your apartment. You can also buy a duvet cover that can be used unfilled in the summertime as a light comforter, and then filled with a heavy duvet in the winter.

            7. Minimize space
            Struggling to minimize items? Minimize the space they take up instead.
            Hang your paper towel roll or mugs under a cabinet. Get wire shelving to maximize space in your cabinets. Instead of keeping all your old photo albums, scan the pictures to your computer. Your family will probably appreciate a slideshow of photos way more than crowding around one photo book.

            8. Bring in less
            Once you’ve minimized the amount of things you own, make sure that you start to limit what you bring into your home, as well. You didn’t do all this work to be undone by a few impulsive shopping sprees.
            Try removing one piece of clothing from your closet for every new item that you purchase. Set yourself a spending limit for new items each month. And be sure to cancel those magazine subscriptions that you don’t read.

            By adopting a more minimalist lifestyle and applying it to your future purchases, you can actually save money.
            Minimalism doesn’t have to be complicated. Make these easy changes to your lifestyle, and you’ll enjoy living with less in no time.
